Please do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

Use one of these channels:

1. Open a private security advisory in this repository:
   `Security` tab -> `Report a vulnerability`
2. If private advisories are unavailable, open a minimal issue marked
   `security` without exploit details and request private follow-up.

## Disclosure Process

- Initial response target: within 72 hours
- Triage and reproduction target: within 7 days
- Fix and coordinated disclosure target: as soon as practical based on severity

We will credit reporters who want attribution after a fix is released.
